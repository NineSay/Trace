DOCUMENTATION

The code reference is an online resource that can be accessed via 'frame8->Optimized ScrollView
Adapter-> Code reference' menu item.
For v3.0 and higher, there's a quick start video guide on youtube, which can be accessed via
'frame8->Optimized ScrollView Adapter-> Quick start video'

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

SRIA ,  BaseParams and  BaseItemViewsHolder are the 3 core classes in our small library dedicated to both
optimize a Scroll View and programmatically manage its contents.
You can use it both for a horizontal or vertical ScrollView.

SRIA i t’s an abstract, generic MonoBehaviour, which you need to extend and provide at least the
implementation of  SRIA.CreateItemViewHolder() and SRIA.UpdateItemViewHolder() .
It's recommended to manually go through example code provided in  ScrollRectItemsAdapterExample.cs
and  SimpleTutorial.cs in order to fully understand the mechanism. You’ll find detailed comments in
core areas. You may even use this script directly without implementing your own, in some simple
scenarios.

(Some may find it more easy to consult the example code+scene directly or the quick start video
tutorial, without reading this document)

IMPLEMENTATION

(Follow these steps while constantly looking at how it’s done in the example code in  SimpleTutorial.cs
and optionally in ScrollRectItemsAdapterExample.cs)
Here’s the normal flow you’ll follow after you’ve created a Scroll View using  GameObject->UI->Scroll
View:
1. create your own implementation of  BaseItemViewsHolder , let's name it  MyItemViewsHolder
2. create your own implementation of  BaseParams (if needed), let's name it  MyParams
3. create your own implementation of  SRIA<MyParams, MyItemViewsHolder> , let's name it
MyScrollRectItemsAdapter
4. override  Start(),  call base.Start(), after which:
5. call  MyScrollRectItemsAdapter.ResetItems(int count) once (and any time your dataset is changed)
and two things will happen:
5.1.  CollectItemsSizes()  will be called (which you can optionally implement to provide your own
sizes, if known beforehand
5.2  CreateViewsHolder(int)  will be called for each view that needs creation. Once a view is created,
it'll be re-used when it goes off-viewport
-  newOrRecycledViewsHolder.root  will be null, so you need to instantiate your prefab), assign it and call
newOrRecycledViewsHolder.CollectViews(). Alternatively, you can call its  AbstractViewHolder.Init(..)
method, which can do a lot of things for you, mainly instantiate the prefab and (if you want) call
CollectViews()
- after creation, only  MyScrollRectItemsAdapter.UpdateItemViewHolder() will be called for it when its
represented item changes and becomes visible
- this method is also called when the viewport's size grows, thus needing more items to be visible at once
5.3 . MyScrollRectItemsAdapter.UpdateViewsHolder(MyItemViewsHolder) will be called when an item is
to be displayed or simply needs updating:
- use  newOrRecycledViewsHolder.ItemIndex to get the item index, so you can retrieve its associated
model from your data set (most common practice is to store the data list in your  Params  implementation)
-  newOrRecycledViewsHolder.root is not null here (given the view holder was properly created in
CreateViewsHolder(..) ). It's assigned a valid object whose UI elements only need their values changed
(common practice is to implement helper methods in the view holder that take the model and update
the views themselves)
ResetItems()  is also called when the viewport's size changes (like for orientation changes on mobile or
window resizing on sandalone platforms)
EXAMPLE SCENES & UTILITIES
All the example scenes & the utlity scripts are provided on an "as-is" base. Their main purpose is to
demonstrate the feature-set and show you the basic code-flow when implementing the adapter,
following the recommended best-practices & conventions.

KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS

- If building for Universal Windows Platform, you must replace  StandardInputModule  with
SRIAStandardInputModule  or, if you're already using a custom input module, subclass it from this instead
of StandardInputModule. If this is not possible,  ISRIAPointerInputModule  should be implemented by it
(more details in ISRIAPointerInputModule.cs). Similarly, for older Unity versions where  TouchInputModule
should also be present,  SRIATouchInputModule was provided. These modules contain a single method
which gives access to some internal data needed by SRIA
- Not actually related to the plugin itself, but worth mentioning: some lower-end devices have terrible
performance with Open GL 3 and/or Auto Graphics API. If you experience oddly low FPS, untick Auto
Graphics API and use Open GL 2 instead.
- In the ContentSizeFitter example scene: the prefab's Text will be oddly truncated if its "Vertical
Overflow" property is set to "Truncate". So a as general rule, set it to "Overflow" when you have similar
scenarios. Likewise, if you have a horizontal ScrollView, the "Horizontal Overflow" property is the one to
be modified.
