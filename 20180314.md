Super ScrollView for UGUI 2.2
Overview
LoopListView2 is a component attaching to the same gameobject of UGUI ScrollRect. It helps
the UGUI ScrollRect to support any count items with high performance and memory-saving.
For a ScrollRect with 10,000 items, LoopListView2 does not really create 10,000 items, but
create a few items based on the size of the viewport.
When the ScrollRect moving up, for example, the LoopListView2 component would check
the topmost item’s position, and once the topmost item is out of the viewport, then the
LoopListView2 component would recycle the topmost item, and at the same time check the
downmost item’s position, and once the downmost item is near the bottom of the viewport , the
LoopListView2 component would call the onGetItemByIndex handler to create a new item and
then positon the new created item under the downmost item, so the new created item becomes
the new downmost item.
Every item can use a different prefab and can have different height/width.
There are several examples to help you learn the LoopListView2 component, in the folder
with path : Assets -> SuperScrollView -> Demo -> Scenes. And Menu scene is the entry.
The following picture is what a TopToButtom arranged scrollrect looks like:
In the above picture, the scrollrect have 10000 items, but in fact, only 7 items really created.
Inspector Settings
In the Inspector, to make sure the  LoopListView2 component works well, there are several
parameters need to set:
ItemPrefabList: this is the existing items to clone.
Every item can use a different prefab and every prefab can have different default padding( the
amount of spacing between each item in the scrollrect). And also, every prefab can have different
default x local pos(for Vertical scrollrect) or default y local pos(for Horizontal scrollrect), and here,
is called (X/Y)PosOffset. Every prefab has a pool for getting and recycling action, and the
InitCreateCount is the count created in pool at start.
In fact, in runtime, every item can have different padding and (X/Y)PosOffset, you can change an
item’s padding and (X/Y)PosOffset in your  onGetItemByIndex callback. You can get/set them
by LoopListViewItem2. Padding and LoopListViewItem2. StartPosOffset.
Important note: All the itemPrefab’s localScale need to be (1,1,1).
SupportScrollbar: if checked, the LoopListView2 component would support scrollbar.
ItemSnapEnable:
if checked, the LoopListView2 component would try to snap item to the configed location in
viewport.
ItemSnapPivot is the location of the snap pivot point of the item, defined as a fraction of the size
of the rectangle itself. 0,0 corresponds to the lower left corner while 1,1 corresponds to the
upper right corner.
ViewPortSnapPivot is the location of the snap pivot point of the ScrollRect ViewPort, defined as a
fraction of the size of the rectangle itself. 0,0 corresponds to the lower left corner while 1,1
corresponds to the upper right corner.
ArrangeType: the scroll direction, there are four types:
(1) TopToBottom: this type is used for a vertical scrollrect, and the item0,item1,…itemN are
positioned one by one from top to bottom in the scrollrect viewport, just like the
following:
(2) BottomToTop: this type is used for a vertical scrollrect, and the item0,item1,…itemN are
positioned one by one from bottom to top in the scrollrect viewport, just like the
following:
(3) LeftToRight: this type is used for a horizontal scrollrect, and the item0,item1,…itemN are
positioned one by one from left to right in the scrollrect viewport.
(4) RightToLeft: this type is used for a horizontal scrollrect, and the item0,item1,…itemN are
positioned one by one from right to left in the scrollrect viewport.
Important Public Method
InitListView method is to initiate the LoopListView2 component. There are 3 parameters:
itemTotalCount: the total item count in the scrollview. If this parameter is set -1, then means
there are infinite items, and scrollbar would not be supported, and the ItemIndex can be from
–MaxInt to +MaxInt. If this parameter is set sssa value >=0 , then the ItemIndex can only be from
0 to itemTotalCount -1.
onGetItemByIndex: when an item is getting in the scrollrect viewport, this Action will be called
with the item’ index as a parameter, to let you create the item and update its content.
LoopListViewItem2 is the return value of  onGetItemByIndex
Every created item has a LoopListViewItem2 component auto attached:
LoopListViewItem2 component is very sample:
The mItemIndex property indicates the item’s index in the list, as mentioned above, if
itemTotalCount is set -1, then the mItemIndex can be from –MaxInt to +MaxInt. If
itemTotalCount is set a value >=0 , then the mItemIndex can only be from 0 to itemTotalCount
-1.
The mItemId property indicates the item’s id. This property is set when the item is created or
fetched from pool, and will no longer change until the item is recycled back to pool.
The following codes is an example of  onGetItemByIndex :
LoopListViewItem2 OnGetItemByIndex(LoopListView2 listView, int index)
{
if (index < 0 || index >= DataSourceMgr.Get.TotalItemCount)
{
return null;
}
//get the data to showing
ItemData itemData = DataSourceMgr.Get.GetItemDataByIndex(index);
if(itemData == null)
{
return null;
}
/* get a new item. E E very item can use a different prefab, the  parameter of the
NewListViewItem is
the prefab ’ name.
And all the prefabs should be listed in  ItemPrefabList in LoopListView2 Inspector
Setting */
LoopListViewItem2 item = listView.NewListViewItem( "ItemPrefab1") );
ListItem2 itemScript = item.GetComponent<ListItem2>();
// IsInitHandlerCalled is false means this item is new created but not  fetched from
pool.
if (item.IsInitHandlerCalled == false)
{
item.IsInitHandlerCalled = true;
itemScript.Init(); // here to init the item, such as add button click event listener.
}
//update the item ’ s content for showing, such as image,text.
itemScript.SetItemData(itemData,index);
return item;
}
This method is used to get a new item, and the new item is a clone from the prefab named
itemPrefabName. This method is usually used in  onGetItemByIndex. .
This method may use to set the item total count of the scrollview at runtime. If this parameter is
set -1, then means there are infinite items, and scrollbar would not be supported, and the
ItemIndex can be from –MaxInt to +MaxInt. If this parameter is set a value >=0 , then the
ItemIndex can only be from 0 to itemTotalCount -1.
If resetPos is set false, then the scrollrect’s content position will not changed after this method
finished.
To get the visible item by itemIndex. If the item is not visible, then this method return null.
All visible items is stored in a List<LoopListViewItem2> , which is named mItemList ; this method
is to get the visible item by the index in visible items list. The parameter index is from 0 to
mItemList.Count.
To get the total count of all visible items.
To update a item by itemIndex. if the itemIndex-th item is not visible, then this method will do
nothing. Otherwise this method will first call  onGetItemByIndex (itemIndex) to get an
updated item and then reposition all visible items’ position.
This method will update all visible items.
This method will move the scrollrect content’s position to ( the positon of itemIndex-th item +
offset ), and in current version the itemIndex is from 0 to MaxInt, offset is from 0 to scrollrect
viewport size.
For a vertical scrollrect, when a visible item’s height changed at runtime, then this method should
be called to let the LoopListView2 component reposition all visible items’ position.
For a horizontal scrollrect, when a visible item’s width changed at runtime, then this method
should be called to let the LoopListView2 component reposition all visible items’ position.
Snap move will finish at once.
Get the nearest item index with the viewport snap point.
Set the snap target item index. This method is used in PageViewDemo.
Clear current snap target and then the LoopScrollView2 will auto snap to the
CurSnapNearestItemIndex.
